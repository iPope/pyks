Based on the original concept and code from bavardage on GitHub: https://github.com/bavardage/Kiloseconds.git

***USAGE***

STANDALONE:
Returns the current time and the time in kiloseconds in the following format:

"The current time is: HH:MM:SS
In kiloseconds, this is: xx.xxx ks"

IMPORTED:
The following functions can be accessed when imported:

this_ks()
	Returns the current kilosecond time as a float integer.
	Takes no arguments.
	
from_ks(ks)
	Converts a kilosceond time back into a human-readable HH:MM:SS time string.
	The same effect can be acheived using ks.to_regex(), using '%H:%M:%S' as the regex.
	Returns as string.
	Takes exactly one argument: the ks to convert as a float integer.
	
format_ks(ks, __format)
	Formats the given kiloseconds value using the given regular expression.
    __format must be similar to: '%H:%M:%S' Each part represents the hour, minute or second and each can be ommitted as appropriate, as long as it is similar to this string.
	Returns as string.
	Takes exactly 2 arguments: the __format as a string and the ks as a float.
	
***INSTALLATION***

Run the command: "setup.py install"

***EXCEPTIONS***

format_ks() may raise an exception if the __format argument is invalid, valid strings are listed below. If an exception is raised, a PyksInternalError will be raised detailing the problem, allowing the caller to handle the exception in their own way.

***VALID ARGUMENT STRUCTURE FOR format_ks().__format***

The __format argument should be structured using these parts:

%H : Corresponds to the hour section of HH:MM:SS
%M : Corresponds to minutes
%S : Corresponds to seconds

These should be seperated using colons and each segment can be re-ordered or ommitted as appropriate.
