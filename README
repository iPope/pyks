Based on the original concept and code from bavardage on GitHub: https://github.com/bavardage/Kiloseconds.git

***USAGE***

STANDALONE:
Returns the current time and the time in kiloseconds in the following format:

"The current time is: HH:MM:SS
In kiloseconds, this is: xx.xxx ks"

IMPORTED:
The following functions can be accessed when imported:

ks.this_ks()
	Returns the current kilosecond time as a float integer.
	Takes no arguments.
	Accessed through: pyks.ks.this_ks()
	
ks.from_ks(ks)
	Converts a kilosceond time back into a human-readable HH:MM:SS time string.
	The same effect can be acheived using ks.to_regex(), using '%H:%M:%S' as the regex.
	Returns as string.
	Takes exactly one argument: the ks to convert as a float integer.
	Accessed through pyks.ks.from_ks(ks)
	
ks.to_regex(regex, ks)
	Formats the given kiloseconds value using the given regular expression.
    Regex must be similar to: '%H:%M:%S. Each part represents the hour, minute or second and each can be ommitted as appropriate, as long as it is similar to this string.
	Returns as string.
	Takes exactly 2 arguments: the regular expression as a string and the ks as a float.
	Accessed through pyks.ks.to_regex(regex,ks)
